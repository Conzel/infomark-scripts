# Infomark Helper Scripts
We are maintaining some small scripts to help tutors work with infomark. 

## infomark-unzipper.py
Unzips the infomark-autogenerated zip files and places the student zip files into a folder which can be easily imported into a java IDE.

To use, install click
`pip install click`
Call the script using python3 and provide the path to an automatically generated infomark-zipfile.
`python3 infomark-unzipper.py path/to/infomark/generated/zip`
You will be prompted for a sheet number which is used to generate the naming. The results will be found in a "...-unzipped" folder in the directory you started the script from.
